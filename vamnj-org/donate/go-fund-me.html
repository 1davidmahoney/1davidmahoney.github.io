    <h1>Funding idea</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Start a <a href="https://youtu.be/1hNhrfcGwY8?si=Bxn3DEX1QaUio1ps" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GoFundMe</a> account.</li>
        <li>Whenever we have a major project we'd like help funding, use GoFundMe to run a fundraiser campaign.</li>
        <li>Link to the campaign from our list of &ldquo;funding goals and dream projects,&rdquo; mention it on social media, and just generally tell everyone we know.</li>
        <li>Update the list as we go, crossing out goals as they're achieved and adding special notes for ones that were crowd-funded.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>For example:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Start a campaign to raise $10,000 for a nice classic car.</li>
        <li>Keep it as a permanent &ldquo;photo op&rdquo; vehicle for visitors to take pictures in.</li>
        <li>On our web page, mark the goal as &ldquo;successfully crowd-funded,&rdquo; so people can see that they really can make a difference by donating.</li>
    </ul>
