                <h2>Our Mission</h2>
                <p>The Vintage Automobile Museum of New Jersey's primary goal is to provide an educational and entertaining family attraction that preserves, shares, and takes pride in the automotive heritage that truly shaped the growth of our state, our country, and indeed the entire world.</p>

                <h2>Our History</h2>
                <h3>Founding</h3>
                <p>The Vintage Automobile Museum of New Jersey was incorporated in 2000.</p>
                <p>At first, we were simply a group of passionate collectors who liked to talk cars. Although we didn't yet have a building, we knew we wanted to share our love of automotive history with the community and to recognize automobiles' monumental impact on the world.</p>
                <h3>Community Engagement</h3>
                <p>The first step toward realizing our vision for the museum was to reach out to the community. Through coordination with local schools and organizations, we have been able to run many outreach programs that help educate and unite our community. For example, our <span class="bolded">History on Wheels</span> program is an educational pop-up car show where students can observe history up close and see for themselves how design, style, and engineering have evolved over time. With our <span class="bolded">STEM Summer Program for Kids</span> &ndash; thanks to a partnership with <em>Save Bargenat Bay</em> &ndash; we deliver hands-on science and engineering activities for kids, such as making air-propelled cars that can taken home afteward. We also love visiting local <span class="bolded">assisted-living and 55+ communities</span> to help enrich the lives of residents with beautiful car displays. It's the perfect way for residents to share memories and create new ones!</p>
                <p>The museum also participates in and sponsors many other events throughout the year, such as parades, car shows, flea markets, and collaborations with local car clubs. See our full list of <a href="/vamnj-org/events/">events</a> for more info.</p>
                <p>Please feel free to <a href="/vamnj-org/contact/">reach out</a> if you or your organization is interested in our educational programs, community events, or other fun collaboration ideas.</p>
                <h3>A Museum for You</h3>
                <p>We are proud to serve New Jersey as the state's <span class="bolded">only public car museum</span>. Admission is always free because we believe that everyone should be able to share in the joy of cars.</p>
                <p>In 2013, thanks to the community's support and a lot of hard work, we were able to secure a building in Point Pleasant, NJ, where we could finally provide a permanent location that anyone could visit.</p>
                <h3>A Museum by You</h3>
                <p>VAMNJ is staffed by volunteers from all throughout Ocean County, NJ. We love cars as much as you do, and we are thrilled to be able to enjoy them together with you!</p>
                <p>For more info about volunteer opportunities with the museum, please see the <a href="/vamnj-org/membership/#volunteer">membership page</a>.</p>
