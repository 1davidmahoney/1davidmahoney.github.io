                <h2>Our Founding</h2>
                <p>The New Jersey Public Auto Museum was incorporated in 2000, known then as the Vintage Automobile Museum of New Jersey.</p>
                <p>At first, we were simply a group of passionate collectors who liked to talk cars. Although we didn't yet have a building, we knew we wanted to share our love of automotive history with the community and to recognize automobiles' monumental impact on the world.</p>

                <h2>History on Wheels</h2>
                <p>The first step toward realizing our vision for the organization was our &ldquo;History on Wheels&rdquo; program, where we'd coordinate with local schools to provide educational pop-up shows for students.</p>
                <p>With cars from all eras lined up outside, students would get a chance to observe history up close and to see for themselves how design, style, and engineering have evolved over time.</p>
                <p>Our History on Wheels program is still going strong! Please feel free to <a href="/vamnj/contact.html">reach out</a> if your organization is interested in this program or some other fun collaboration.</p>

                <h2>Our Mission</h2>
                <p>The museum's main goal is to provide an educational and entertaining family attraction that will allow us to preserve, share, and take pride in an automotive heritage that truly encouraged and shaped the growth of New Jersey, the United States of America, and indeed the entire world.</p>
                <p>In 2013, thanks to the community's support and a lot of hard work, we were able to secure a building in Point Pleasant, NJ, where we could finally provide a permanent location that anyone could visit. Most recently in 2024, we changed our name in an effort to highlight this focus on serving the public.</p>

                <h2>A Museum for You</h2>
                <p>We are proud to serve New Jersey as the state's only public car museum. Admission is always free because we believe that everyone should be able to share in the joy of cars.</p>
                <p>NJPAM is staffed by volunteers from all throughout Ocean County, NJ. We love cars as much as you do, and we are thrilled to be able to enjoy them together with you!</p>
