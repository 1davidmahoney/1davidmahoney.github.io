                    <h2>I &#9829; storytelling</h2>
                    <p>Stories are of vital importance to us humans. We feel what the narrator feels, their journey moving us to tears, sparking laughter, and raising intrigue. We get excited about how our personal stories will unfold, and we love sharing the best parts with the people we care about.</p>
                    <p>As a narrative-focused game designer, I'm proud to carry on our millenia-old tradition of storytelling in the ever-evolving medium of video games. Below are some of my favorite work samples from <em>Lone Echo II</em>, in which I collaborated on mission design and was responsible for the first-draft writing of dialogue and the visual scripting of dialogue events.</p>
                    <p class="italics">Note: The videos below contain commentary to help illustrate how uniquely powerful a VR experience can feel. The first voice you hear in each video is the commentator.</p>

                    <h3>Astraea Wreckage &ndash; (Re)Introducing Apollo</h3>
                    <p>Designing this section of the game was a fun balancing act. For example, Apollo's alarmed state was an effective way to introduce him in this game, since you get a nice jolt whether you remember him from the first game or are meeting him for the first time right now.</p>
                    <p>The most challenging aspect of the bridge conversation was finding a palatable way to cover all the beats required by the game outline. Ultimately, by striking the right balance between interactivity, spectacle, and fun dialogue, we were able to maintain momentum through this info-heavy scene.</p>

                    <p>Having only heard bits and pieces about a relationship between your companion Dr. Harlan and his former crewmate, the infested research facility offers a surprise revelation: these crusading scientists were in love, but they risked it all to save humanity.</p>
                    <p>Hopefully, their sacrifice will not have been in vain...</p>

                    <h3>Chiron Station &ndash; Humanity's Last Hope</h3>
                    <p>One way the <em>Lone Echo</em> series achieved such a great sense of immersion was by filling the world with side content. For example, tiny research labs scattered throughout Chiron Station provide not just equipment upgrades, but also opportunities to learn more about the hopes, dreams, and fates of the station's former occupants.</p>
                    <p>Part of the challenge of narrative design in such an open world setting is accounting for different player states. As this video shows, players are free to discover many areas on their own; but sometimes, they're not yet equipped to proceed.</p>
