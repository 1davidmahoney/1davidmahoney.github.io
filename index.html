            <h1>Introduction</h1>
            <p>Story is fundamental to the human experience – whether telling a story, imagining one, or living one to tell later. I’ve been honored to continue this age-old tradition through my work on some incredible properties.</p>

            <h1>Lone Echo II</h1>
            <p>As a lifelong sci-fi fan and VR enthusiast, it was a dream come true working on <em>Lone Echo II</em>. Unexpectedly taking this dream a step further, I had the incredible honor of seeing the project win the D.I.C.E. Award for Immersive Reality Game of the Year and be nominated for the Webby Award for Best Narrative Experience.</p>
            <p>In my role as Associate Technical Narrative Designer, I was responsible for delivering a large portion of the game's narrative needs:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://youtu.be/Y-OJlw4teFM?t=1591">Generator A</a> – Learn about your new companions while restoring power.</li>
                <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBIibo0o1Us&amp;t=85s">Astraea Wreckage I</a> &amp; <a href="https://youtu.be/XK4T7drvxy4?t=1351">II</a> – Mend relationships while nabbing alien tech.</li>
                <li><a href="https://youtu.be/jY1ACKXwyjM?t=1496">Research Facility</a> – Learn about your companion’s long-lost love interest while upgrading your robot shell.</li>
                <li><a href="https://youtu.be/qpXpiKsLRcs?t=2181">Chiron Station</a> – Relive the hopes and dreams – and horrible fates – of the former station crew while exploring inside and outside the station.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>I’m especially proud of the dialogue I wrote for the Research Facility, where you discover the <a href="https://youtu.be/jY1ACKXwyjM?t=1020">heart-rending message</a> left behind for one of your companions.</p>
            
            <h1>Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy: The Telltale Series</h1>

            <p>I spent much of my youth daydreaming in the Marvel universe – playing with action figures, reading comics, drawing my own superheroes, and even having a personal rendition of Spider-Man signed by Stan Lee! Little did I know I’d one day have a chance to put my mark on that universe.</p>

            <p>The details below cover the work I did on Marvel’s <em>Guardians of the Galaxy</em> – a franchise known for its unique blend of thrilling adventure and emotional weight. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nzuk-nwGY"><em>Telltale’s standalone season</em></a> contains five episodes.</p>

            <h3>Season-wide</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Stubbed episode descriptions for the download screen.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Episode 1</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Stubbed dialog and stage direction for “Next Time On.”</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Episode 2</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Designed and implemented “Previously On.”</li>
                <li>Stubbed freewalk and station camera interactions.</li>
                <li>Performed design passes.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Episode 4</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Stubbed dialog, stage direction, choices, and action for the spectacle-filled opening scene.</li>
                <li>Stubbed freewalk and station camera interactions.</li>
                <li>Implemented freewalk design.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Episode 5</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Stubbed dialog, stage direction, choices, and interactions for a few scenes – including [spoiler alert!] the dramatic, emotional reunion between Peter and his formerly deceased mother.</li>
                <li>Implemented freewalk design.</li>

            <h1>Introduction</h1>
            <p>This project, the Superhero Puzzle System, was created to demonstrate my systems design skills and my familiarity with Unreal Engine. A playable demo can be found <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1VXMslAYZbZcx0c-FqN5hh-nJOpyQ566I">here</a>.</p>

            <div class="video-container">
                <iframe class="youtube-player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0lMT_xKVojc?version=3&rel=1&showsearch=0&showinfo=1&iv_load_policy=1&fs=1&hl=en&autohide=2&wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen></iframe>
            </div>
            
            <p>In action-adventure games, you’re sometimes tasked with changing the state of some environmental object in order to proceed. For example, you might knock down a tree to create a bridge over a raging river. As a superhero, though, such tasks are often trivial, which begs the question: what’s the greatest challenge to all superheroes? Helpless civilians, of course!</p>
            <p>In the absence of an adequate <em>physical</em> challenge, the player should at least be <em>emotionally</em> challenged. In the example level documented below, the Superhero Puzzle System tasks you with one such challenge: weighing the safety of numerous strangers against the safety of one person you care about.</p>
            <p>Narrative setup:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The villain stands on the front deck of a ferry, seemingly prepared to kill your beloved companion.</li>
                <li>As the city burns, panicked civilians swarm toward the ferry.</li>
                <li>Do you take the time to <em>methodically</em> scare the civilians away, ensuring their safety, but risking your companion’s life? Or, do you hustle to <em>aggressively</em> scare away the civilians, better ensuring your companion’s safety, but risking the civilians’ lives?</li>
            </ul>
            <p>As the city’s only superhero, the people count on you. Unfortunately, in order to reach the villain, your sense of responsibility must be tested. Can you live up to the expectations of being a superhero? Complete the puzzle, and find out!</p>
            
            <h1>System</h1>
            <p>In the example level, light poles line the dock on which panicked civilians are gathering. The player uses the Superhero Puzzle System to overcharge and ignite the poles’ light bulbs, scaring the civilians away from the villain while simultaneously clearing a path toward him.</p>
            <p>The high-level challenge presented by the system is the identification of “good” versus “bad” poles under emotional and temporal constraints. Some poles are “sturdy,” able to be electrified until they burst into flames (“ignited”), thus scaring the civilians away toward safety. Other poles are “broken” and will fall apart upon ignition, possibly injuring nearby civilians and/or damaging nearby structures. Both pole types look deceptively similar, so the player must exercise caution to avoid mistakes.</p>
            
            <figure style="text-align: center;">
                <a href="/images/portfolio/unreal/SHPS_OnePager.png">

                </a>
                <figcaption>Puzzle interactivity</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>The system allows you to play according to your mood and your personal assessment of priorities.</p>
            <p>With each charge, electrical energy in the pole’s light bulb builds up and then dissipates.  If you’re in the mood to play in a more carefree way, you can <em>aggressively</em> spam the “interact” button (5-6 rapid presses) and simply wait for the bulb to be overcharged. Or, if you want to be slick and minimize your input, you can <em>methodically</em> wait until each charge peaks before starting another (just 3 well-timed button presses).</p>
            <p>Some poles are sturdy; some are broken. If you’re prioritizing your companion’s safety, you might use the system <em>aggressively</em>, with reckless abandon, as long as you reach your goal with haste. Or, if you’re prioritizing virtually everyone’s safety, you might take some time to <em>methodically</em> test the limitations of the system, looking for ways to help more people.</p>

            </figure>
            
            <h1>Development</h1>
            <p>One of the biggest challenges in building the system was the “charge” mechanic. Though the Timeline component is a handy feature of Unreal, it proved to be troublesome in this case because of its limitations. To have more control, I realized I’d have to take a more manual approach for easing between values (e.g., lights fading up and down). Fortunately, because more data was exposed, this manual approach made it easier to tune the system in script (Blueprints) and to set it up for in-editor tuning by a level designer (via public variables).</p>

            <figure style="text-align: center;">
                <a href="/images/portfolio/unreal/SHPS_OnePager.png">

                <figcaption>Puzzle interactivity</figcaption>
            </figure>
            
            <p>Another big development challenge was implementing the “broken” pole. Unlike the “sturdy” pole, the “broken” type is rather complex, involving a few unique features: a detachable bulb object; optional “pole destructible” objects which react to broken poles; and a number of ways for civilians to behave, depending on their proximity to the bulb and the presence or absence of a “pole destructible” object.</p>
            
            <h1>Conclusion</h1>
            <p>By offering complementary puzzle pieces – in this case, risky poles, vulnerable civilians, and a helpless companion – the Superhero Action System allows the creation of dynamic and emotional puzzles in a world that feels both fantastical and grounded.</p>
            <p>Beyond the example level presented here, the system could also be used in other emotionally rich yet superhuman contexts. For example, the light poles could be replaced with stubborn containers you pry open in order to attract people, rather than repel them; or you might work at pulling a rope to lift up an elevator full of innocent bystanders.</p>

            <h1>Introduction</h1>
            <p>In this early Unity VR prototype, you play as a god-like war commander of a fantastical army. Use your hands to signal commands to your brave foot soldiers, towering golems, flying warriors, and more!</p>

            </div>
            
            <h1>Development</h1>
            <p>The biggest challenge was the "throw" action, which required careful tuning for it to feel good in the large-scale environment. Because your target is always far away – either in the skies above or on the ground below – the projectile must leave the hand more quickly than might be expected. Too slow and realistic, and you feel oddly underpowered. Too quick, and you feel overpowered and out of control.</p>

            <h1>Next Steps</h1>
            <p>Although I was able to tune the system to a good middle ground, I'm looking forward to trying other aim-assist methods in future iterations of the prototype.</p>
