            <h1>Hello there!</h1>

            <p>Thank you for visiting my portfolio! I hope you enjoy viewing each piece as much as I've enjoyed making it.</p>

            <p>For over a decade, I've been proud and grateful to make a career mixing two of my favorite activities: sharing a good story, and playing with computers. Exploring these pastimes has led to a unique sense of empowerment, wherein I'm able to dream up exciting, emotional narratives and then help make them happen via professional development tools.</p>

            <p>I've worked with proprietary tools (Telltale; RAD) and industry-standard tools (Unreal; Maya) on content ranging from original IP to franchises beloved across "the galaxy..." The scope of work I've done has ranged from mobile QA to VR technical narrative design, from writing dialogue to prototyping new modes of interaction.</p>

            <p>I'm always open to talk shop, so if you'd like to chat, please feel free to reach out!</p>

            <h1>Introduction</h1>
            <p>Story is fundamental to the human experience – whether telling a story, imagining one, or living one to tell later. I’ve been honored to continue this age-old tradition through my work on some incredible properties.</p>

            <h1>Lone Echo II</h1>
            <p>As a lifelong sci-fi fan and VR enthusiast, it was a dream come true working on <em>Lone Echo II</em>. Unexpectedly taking this dream a step further, I had the incredible honor of seeing the project win the D.I.C.E. Award for Immersive Reality Game of the Year and be nominated for the Webby Award for Best Narrative Experience.</p>
            
            <div style="clear: both;"></div> <!-- This div clears the float (piece-image) -->
            
            <p>In my role as Associate Technical Narrative Designer, I was responsible for delivering a large portion of the game's narrative needs:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://youtu.be/Y-OJlw4teFM?t=1591">Generator A</a> – Learn about your new companions while restoring power.</li>

            </ul>

            <p>I’m especially proud of the dialogue I wrote for the Research Facility, where you discover the <a href="https://youtu.be/jY1ACKXwyjM?t=1020">heart-rending message</a> left behind for one of your companions.</p>
            
            <h1>Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy: The Telltale Series</h1>

            <p>I spent much of my youth daydreaming in the Marvel universe – playing with action figures, reading comics, drawing my own superheroes, and even having a personal rendition of Spider-Man signed by Stan Lee! Little did I know I’d one day have a chance to put my mark on that universe.</p>

            <p>The details below cover the work I did on Marvel’s <em>Guardians of the Galaxy</em> – a franchise known for its unique blend of thrilling adventure and emotional weight. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nzuk-nwGY"><em>Telltale’s standalone season</em></a> contains five episodes.</p>

            <h3>Season-wide</h3>
            <ul>

            <h3>Episode 1</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Stubbed dialog and stage direction for “Next Time On.”</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Episode 2</h3>

            <h1>Introduction</h1>
            <p>This project, the Superhero Puzzle System, was created to demonstrate my systems design skills and my familiarity with Unreal Engine. A playable demo can be found <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1VXMslAYZbZcx0c-FqN5hh-nJOpyQ566I">here</a>.</p>

                </div>
            </div>
            
            <p>In action-adventure games, you’re sometimes tasked with changing the state of some environmental object in order to proceed. For example, you might knock down a tree to create a bridge over a raging river. As a superhero, though, such tasks are often trivial, which begs the question: what’s the greatest challenge to all superheroes? Helpless civilians, of course!</p>
            <p>In the absence of an adequate <em>physical</em> challenge, the player should at least be <em>emotionally</em> challenged. In the example level documented below, the Superhero Puzzle System tasks you with one such challenge: weighing the safety of numerous strangers against the safety of one person you care about.</p>
            <p>Narrative setup:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The villain stands on the front deck of a ferry, seemingly prepared to kill your beloved companion.</li>
                <li>As the city burns, panicked civilians swarm toward the ferry.</li>
                <li>Do you take the time to <em>methodically</em> scare the civilians away, ensuring their safety, but risking your companion’s life? Or, do you hustle to <em>aggressively</em> scare away the civilians, better ensuring your companion’s safety, but risking the civilians’ lives?</li>
            </ul>
            <p>As the city’s only superhero, the people count on you. Unfortunately, in order to reach the villain, your sense of responsibility must be tested. Can you live up to the expectations of being a superhero? Complete the puzzle, and find out!</p>
            
            <h1>System</h1>
            <p>In the example level, light poles line the dock on which panicked civilians are gathering. The player uses the Superhero Puzzle System to overcharge and ignite the poles’ light bulbs, scaring the civilians away from the villain while simultaneously clearing a path toward him.</p>
            <p>The high-level challenge presented by the system is the identification of “good” versus “bad” poles under emotional and temporal constraints. Some poles are “sturdy,” able to be electrified until they burst into flames (“ignited”), thus scaring the civilians away toward safety. Other poles are “broken” and will fall apart upon ignition, possibly injuring nearby civilians and/or damaging nearby structures. Both pole types look deceptively similar, so the player must exercise caution to avoid mistakes.</p>
            
            <figure>

                </a>
                <figcaption>Puzzle interactivity</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>The system allows you to play according to your mood and your personal assessment of priorities.</p>
            <p>With each charge, electrical energy in the pole’s light bulb builds up and then dissipates.  If you’re in the mood to play in a more carefree way, you can <em>aggressively</em> spam the “interact” button (5-6 rapid presses) and simply wait for the bulb to be overcharged. Or, if you want to be slick and minimize your input, you can <em>methodically</em> wait until each charge peaks before starting another (just 3 well-timed button presses).</p>
            <p>Some poles are sturdy; some are broken. If you’re prioritizing your companion’s safety, you might use the system <em>aggressively</em>, with reckless abandon, as long as you reach your goal with haste. Or, if you’re prioritizing virtually everyone’s safety, you might take some time to <em>methodically</em> test the limitations of the system, looking for ways to help more people.</p>

            </figure>
            
            <h1>Development</h1>
            <p>One of the biggest challenges in building the system was the “charge” mechanic. Though the Timeline component is a handy feature of Unreal, it proved to be troublesome in this case because of its limitations. To have more control, I realized I’d have to take a more manual approach for easing between values (e.g., lights fading up and down). Fortunately, because more data was exposed, this manual approach made it easier to tune the system in script (Blueprints) and to set it up for in-editor tuning by a level designer (via public variables).</p>

            <figure>
                <a href="/images/portfolio/unreal/SHPS_Blueprint.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">

            </figure>

                <figcaption>Tuning variables exposed for Level/Mission Designers</figcaption>
            </figure>
            
            <p>Another big development challenge was implementing the “broken” pole. Unlike the “sturdy” pole, the “broken” type is rather complex, involving a few unique features: a detachable bulb object; optional “pole destructible” objects which react to broken poles; and a number of ways for civilians to behave, depending on their proximity to the bulb and the presence or absence of a “pole destructible” object.</p>
            
            <h1>Conclusion</h1>
            <p>By offering complementary puzzle pieces – in this case, risky poles, vulnerable civilians, and a helpless companion – the Superhero Action System allows the creation of dynamic and emotional puzzles in a world that feels both fantastical and grounded.</p>
            <p>Beyond the example level presented here, the system could also be used in other emotionally rich yet superhuman contexts. For example, the light poles could be replaced with stubborn containers you pry open in order to attract people, rather than repel them; or you might work at pulling a rope to lift up an elevator full of innocent bystanders.</p>

            <h1>Development</h1>
            <p>The biggest challenge was the "throw" action, which required careful tuning for it to feel good in the large-scale environment. Because your target is always far away – either in the skies above or on the ground below – the projectile must leave the hand more quickly than might be expected. Too slow and realistic, and you feel oddly underpowered. Too quick, and you feel overpowered and out of control.</p>

            <h1>Next Steps</h1>
            <p>Although I was able to tune the system to a good middle ground, I'm looking forward to trying other aim-assist methods in future iterations of the prototype.</p>

            <h1>Introduction</h1>
            <p>In its original incarnation, Telltale Games was a fast-paced studio, so it was understandable that priorities could shift rapidly and that you’d often be expected to solve your own problems. Fortunately, I was able to turn a few of the big challenges I came across into fun side-projects.</p>
            <p>Over the years, my experience with dialog has ranged from practical to experimental. As a Creative Development Assistant (CDA), I built the first two projects below to solve a couple problems that were dragging down certain dialog-related workflows. Now that I’ve moved on from Telltale, it’s been fun thinking of other exciting ways to explore the world of dialog and narrative—an example of which can be seen in the third project below.</p>

            <p>For the CDA, dialog-related work was a daily occurrence, but when it came time for a certain process that occurred a couple times per episode, the work became needlessly cumbersome because of a lack of tools specific to the task. After consulting with senior engineering staff, I set about solving this efficiency problem by writing a tool of my own in C++.</p>
            <p>More specifically, my program made use of HTML-embedded JavaScript and automated mouse clicks and button-presses to rapidly operate and transfer data between Telltale’s proprietary tool, a web browser, and the operating system’s clipboard.</p>
            <p>Using my program, I was happy to save myself and my fellow CDAs somewhere around 75% of the work previously required to complete this task.</p>

            <h1>File Management System for VO Processing</h1>
            <p>Like the program above, my file management system was created to address a specific problem I had encountered while working as a CDA.</p>
            <p>When it came time to add special effects to voiceover (e.g., distortion when talking through a walkie-talkie), the CDA would receive a list of VO audio files to move to a specific folder, making them readily available for the Audio department. Like before, I found myself wondering if this task could be easier; and thanks to batch scripting, it was.</p>
            <p>By combining a batch script, specially tagged lines of dialog, and existing functionality within Telltale’s proprietary tool, I was able to design a system which streamlined the process of identifying and relocating VO files in need of special effects—an improvement which eased workloads for myself and at least a few of my coworkers.</p>
            <p>In addition to the satisfaction of having designed a useful system, it was great having the chance to collaborate with like-minded individuals in the Production and Audio departments toward solving a problem that had regularly affected us all.</p>

            <h1>Natural NPC Interaction System</h1>
            <p>This theoretical system is meant to bridge the experientially disruptive gap that games sometimes insert between the player’s button press and the NPC’s behavior.</p>
            <p>In many adventure-type games, when interacting with an NPC, I’ve often been jarred by a button-press that leads to an NPC’s action rather than my own. For example, <em>The Last of Us</em> handles dialog interactions fairly well by leading most of their resultant cinematic segments (i.e., acting) with a line/action from Joel (the player character, or “PC”); however, pressing the interaction button can also mean “Make Ellie talk,” which may make some players feel disconnected from the gameplay. In a more recent title, <em>Horizon Zero Dawn</em>, the transition into cinematic segments can be even more jarring, as pressing the interaction button could mean “Cut to a completely new camera angle; and also make the NPC talk.”</p>
            <p>To alleviate this issue, I’ve designed a slightly more complex, yet significantly more natural-feeling system—one modeled after the relatable concepts of personal space and situational awareness. With this system, a game may have more intuitive interactions by providing a simple, reasonable explanation as to why their resultant cinematics are led by the PC or by the NPC.</p>

            <p>Every NPC has an “awareness zone”; when the player enters it, interaction UI appears over the NPC’s head, indicating that the NPC is now aware of the player’s presence and is interactable—i.e., a button-press may now trigger a cinematic segment which is led by the PC speaking to / acting upon the NPC.</p>

            </figure>
            
            <p>Additionally, each NPC has “personal space,” which is like the awareness zone, but with a tighter radius and a stronger—and possibly unexpected—reaction. Upon entering an NPC’s personal space, the player has a short amount of time to press the interaction button before the NPC will react to the player’s proximity; in general, happy NPCs allow more time, whereas angry NPCs allow less time. The activation of this new mode of interaction is made clear by an accented button prompt that fades out over a few seconds.</p>

            <h1>Introduction</h1>
            <p>Throughout college, I spent a lot of time prototyping mechanics for classes and for fun. My appreciation for the intuitive and accessible nature of smartphones led to these prototypes being largely focused toward mobile devices. Below are a few of my favorite ventures into mobile game design.</p>

            <h2>Development</h2>
            <p>This Flash-based game is my favorite mobile prototype for a few reasons, one of the biggest being the technical hurdles I had to overcome. Confronted with the need to script with raw trigonometry, I was intimidated by the challenge but excited to tackle it. Thankfully, the effort was worth it, as I learned valuable new skills along the way and ended up with a new and interesting style of game.</p>

            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p><em>Tabs</em> is meant to feel like a real-world, handheld puzzle. In each round of gameplay, you’re faced with a jumbled configuration of tabs which must be set right. To complete each round, you hold and drag each tab, rotating it about its pivot, trying to get its other end to land on a target.</p>
            
            <div style="clear: both;"></div> <!-- This div clears the float (piece-image) -->
            
            <h2>Development</h2>
            <p>Because <em>Tabs</em> is physics-based, I knew development would be a challenge, so I went through a few prototyping phases to ensure I was heading toward an end-product that would work well and feel good. The first prototype was physical, using paper, cardboard, and push-pins to approximate my original vision for the game.</p>

            <p>With this real-world artifact, I was able to assess the game idea’s viability as an entertainment product, and to then begin the documentation process in earnest, which in turn allowed me to explore new mechanics and puzzle configurations.</p>

            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p><em>Bomb Defuser</em> tasks you with quickly arranging tiles to match a specified pattern. Fail three times, and the device explodes!

            <p>The <em>Bomb Defuser</em> prototype was created in Flash and deployed on iPhone and iPad for testing.</p>
            <p>The biggest challenge was the line-drawing system. Each target pattern (in the small window at the bottom of the screen) is randomized, as are the lines connecting the pattern’s tiles. Furthermore, once the pattern is matched in the play area, lines grow from the play area’s tiles, matching the lines in the target pattern (see video above).</p>

            <p><em style="color: #ff2b00; font-weight: bold;">Beck</em><span style="color: #ff2b00;">, a supporting character</span>, is outgoing but gullible. She makes her own rules, but she shields herself with routine. Age: 17. Upbringing: sheltered. Superpower: splitting molecules.</p>
            
            <h1>Setting</h1>
            <p><em>Dusk</em>. A grassy clearing in the woods. The school, an old mansion, lies far in the distance.</p>

                <p class="script-action">EXT. SCHOOL GROUNDS – CLEARING</p>

                <p class="script-action">TOMMY, a teenaged boy wearing a school uniform, enters a clearing far from the mansion. He agitatedly swats tall reeds away from his face, then pauses for a breath. He looks back at the mansion and sighs heavily. He turns forward again, grimacing at the dreary path ahead.</p>

                <p class="script-char char-a">TOMMY</p>
                <p class="script-par char-a">(frustrated, to himself)</p>

                <p class="script-dlg char-a">It’s time to–</p>

                <p class="script-action">Tommy begrudgingly pulls out an antique pocket watch, but it’s becoming too dark outside to see well, so he balls his hand into a fist and then quickly fans out his fingers, causing a glowing ball of smoky light to form in mid-air, inches from his hand. The watch is beautiful. Tommy slowly moves his sphere of light, forcing its reflection to flow around the watch’s ornate etchings, mesmerizing himself in the process. He’s snapped back to reality as he turns the watch, revealing a crudely welded seam along the lid’s edge.</p>

                <p class="script-char char-a">TOMMY</p>
                <p class="script-dlg char-a">Friggin’ cavemen, I swear...</p>

                <p class="script-action">Tommy gazes once more at his beloved memento as he slowly extinguishes his light, then pockets the watch.</p>

                <p class="script-char char-a">TOMMY</p>
                <p class="script-dlg char-a">Sorry, Pop.</p>

                <p class="script-action">Tommy eyes the faint treetops pensively, then shakes his head with dissatisfaction.</p>

                <p class="script-char char-a">TOMMY</p>
                <p class="script-dlg char-a">[sigh]</p>

                <p class="script-dlg char-b">Hey! Hold it!</p>

                <p class="script-action">A teenage girl, BECK, in an identical school uniform stands several yards ahead of Tommy, blocking his way to the school and pointing her hands at him in a threatening but awkward manner. Tommy is briefly alarmed, but he quickly collects himself, as if he were expecting an unpleasant surprise anyway.</p>

                <p class="script-char char-b">BECK</p>
                <p class="script-dlg char-b">What’re you doing out here?! You a spy or somethin’?!</p>

                <p class="script-char char-a">TOMMY</p>
                <p class="script-par char-a">(agitated)</p>
                <p class="script-dlg char-a">Are you serious? I’m a student... We’re wearing the same uniform... We were at orientation together!</p>

                <p class="script-action">As Tommy rudely explains away Beck’s suspicion, she eases her offensive stance, instead looking a bit annoyed.</p>

                <p class="script-char char-b">BECK</p>
                <p class="script-par char-b">(sardonic)</p>
                <p class="script-dlg char-b">Okay, not a spy. Just another grumpy-ass “gifted youngster.” Cool.</p>

                <p class="script-action">Tommy drops his shoulders for a beat, embarrassed at his rudeness.</p>

                <p class="script-char char-a">TOMMY</p>
                <p class="script-par char-a">(disappointed)</p>
                <p class="script-dlg char-a">*Not* cool. Look, I don’t usually flip out like that. It’s just that–</p>

                <p class="script-action">Beck is disarmed, realizing Tommy’s idea of “flipping out” is pretty timid. Tommy humbly produces his pocket watch and gestures as if to offer a look to Beck, who begins calmly approaching.</p>

                <p class="script-char char-b">BECK</p>
                <p class="script-par char-b">(vaguely sympathetic)</p>
                <p class="script-dlg char-b">Lemme guess. Bully broke your stuff?</p>

                <p class="script-action">Tommy gets lost in thought for a beat upon seeing the watch again, but collects himself for an actual answer.</p>

                <p class="script-char char-a">TOMMY</p>
                <p class="script-par char-a">(sarcastic)</p>
                <p class="script-dlg char-a">Some *tough* guy welded it shut ‘cause I–</p>

                <p class="script-char char-a">TOMMY</p>
                <p class="script-par char-a">(downtrodden)</p>
                <p class="script-dlg char-a">Guess I was just looking at it too much.</p>

                <p class="script-action">Beck reaches Tommy and puts her hand out to receive the watch, but Tommy awkwardly backs away a step.</p>

                <p class="script-char char-a">TOMMY</p>
                <p class="script-par char-a">(stalling)</p>
                <p class="script-dlg char-a">Er...</p>

                <p class="script-char char-b">BECK</p>
                <p class="script-par char-b">(teasing)</p>
                <p class="script-dlg char-b">Oh. Not big on sharing, huh?</p>

                <p class="script-char char-a">TOMMY</p>
                <p class="script-par char-a">(meek chuckle)</p>
                <p class="script-dlg char-a">It’s just, uh...</p>

                <p class="script-char char-b">BECK</p>
                <p class="script-dlg char-b">It’s alright, dude. We’re all here ‘cause we don’t play well with others, right?</p>

                <p class="script-action">Tommy smiles faintly in appreciation and loosens up.</p>

                <p class="script-char char-a">TOMMY</p>
                <p class="script-dlg char-a">Right.</p>

                <p class="script-action">Their eye contact becomes awkward as they realize they’re actually “playing well” with each other. Beck nods toward the path behind Tommy.</p>

                <p class="script-char char-b">BECK</p>
                <p class="script-dlg char-b">So what changed your mind?</p>

                <p class="script-action">Tommy glances at the path behind him.</p>

                <p class="script-char char-a">TOMMY</p>
                <p class="script-dlg char-a">What, about leaving? How’d you know I was–</p>

                <p class="script-char char-b">BECK</p>
                <p class="script-dlg char-b">Bright ball of light in the middle of an open field... at night...? Kinda hard to miss.</p>

                <p class="script-action">Tommy shifts uncomfortably, realizing someone caught him being vulnerable. Beck glares back at the school in the distance.</p>

                <p class="script-char char-b">BECK</p>
                <p class="script-dlg char-b">Why go back to that dusty old heap, especially knowing you’re gonna run into your old pal?</p>

                <p class="script-char char-a">TOMMY</p>
                <p class="script-par char-a">(serious)</p>
                <p class="script-dlg char-a">‘Cause I’m gonna make that guy answer for this.</p>

                <p class="script-action">Tommy pockets the watch again.</p>

                <p class="script-char char-a">TOMMY</p>
                <p class="script-dlg char-a">One way or another.</p>

                <p class="script-char char-b">BECK</p>
                <p class="script-dlg char-b">Props for stepping up. But if he mangled your stuff *that* badly...?</p>

                <p class="script-char char-b">BECK</p>
                <p class="script-par char-b">(half-joking)</p>
                <p class="script-dlg char-b">Pretty sure you and that watch are just gonna get melted down.</p>

                <p class="script-char char-a">TOMMY</p>
                <p class="script-par char-a">(awkward)</p>
                <p class="script-dlg char-a">Ha...</p>

                <p class="script-char char-a">TOMMY</p>
                <p class="script-par char-a">(sighs)</p>
                <p class="script-dlg char-a">Yeah.</p>

                <p class="script-action">Beck jokingly feigns irritation and puts out her hand, as if expecting something. Tommy is skeptical, but she insists by gesturing toward the watch, which Tommy finally hands to her.</p>

                <p class="script-char char-b">BECK</p>
                <p class="script-par char-b">(teasing)</p>
                <p class="script-dlg char-b">Don’t freak out, now.</p>

                <p class="script-action">Beck concentrates on the watch, then makes a wide circular motion with her free hand. She hands the watch back to Tommy, and he looks at it and her incredulously.</p>

                <p class="script-char char-a">TOMMY</p>
                <p class="script-dlg char-a">It’s still–</p>

                <p class="script-action">Beck smirks and taps on the lid, causing it to flip open.</p>

                <p class="script-char char-a">TOMMY</p>
                <p class="script-par char-a">(shocked)</p>
                <p class="script-dlg char-a">You did it! I didn’t think... I mean... Thank you. Seriously.</p>

                <p class="script-char char-b">BECK</p>
                <p class="script-dlg char-b">Yeah, well, I don’t work for free, and it’s, uh...</p>

                <p class="script-action">Beck gestures at the darkness surrounding them. Tommy sheepishly pats his body as if searching for a missing wallet.</p>

                <p class="script-char char-a">TOMMY</p>
                <p class="script-dlg char-a">I, uh... didn’t pack much, so I don’t really...</p>

                <p class="script-char char-b">BECK</p>
                <p class="script-par char-b">(laughs)</p>
                <p class="script-dlg char-b">No worries. Really just need a light for the return trip, y’know?</p>

                <p class="script-action">Tommy looks determinedly at the mansion, then smiles warmly at Beck.</p>

                <p class="script-char char-a">TOMMY</p>
                <p class="script-dlg char-a">You got it.</p>

                <p class="script-action">The pair begins walking through the darkening woods toward the mansion. Tommy ignites a light sphere again.</p>

                <p class="script-char char-a">TOMMY</p>
                <p class="script-par char-a">(lighthearted)</p>
                <p class="script-dlg char-a">So, uh... Late-night spy-hunting... Is that a regular thing for you? Not that I’m judging or anything...</p>

                <p class="script-action">Beck looks slightly embarrassed.</p>

                <p class="script-char char-b">BECK</p>
                <p class="script-dlg char-b">Been running away every night for the past week.</p>

                <p class="script-char char-b">BECK</p>
                <p class="script-dlg char-b">But then it starts getting dark, and I’m actually kinda...</p>

                <p class="script-char char-a">TOMMY</p>
                <p class="script-par char-a">(gentle disbelief)</p>
                <p class="script-dlg char-a">...afraid of the dark?</p>

                <p class="script-char char-b">BECK</p>
                <p class="script-par char-b">(stubborn)</p>
                <p class="script-dlg char-b">I just have a good imagination, is all.</p>

                <p class="script-char char-b">BECK</p>
                <p class="script-dlg char-b">Speaking of which, got a few ideas about getting back at that stupid bully of yours.</p>

                <p class="script-char char-a">TOMMY</p>
                <p class="script-par char-a">(laughs)</p>
                <p class="script-dlg char-a">You’re kinda twisted, huh?</p>

                <p class="script-char char-b">BECK</p>
                <p class="script-par char-b">(joking)</p>
                <p class="script-dlg char-b">Just enough to get a room at *this* place, apparently.</p>

                <p class="script-char char-a">TOMMY</p>
                <p class="script-par char-a">(joking)</p>
                <p class="script-dlg char-a">Guess I need to step it up a notch, then...</p>

                <p class="script-char char-b">BECK</p>
                <p class="script-par char-b">(half-serious)</p>
                <p class="script-dlg char-b">Not too much, though, alright? Got enough weirdos running around this place as it is.</p>

                <p class="script-char char-a">TOMMY</p>
                <p class="script-par char-a">(laughs)</p>
                <p class="script-dlg char-a">No promises.</p>

                <p class="script-action">Beck gives Tommy a mischievous grin, and the two continue into the dark woods toward the school, guided by Tommy’s smoky sphere of light.</p>
