                    <h1>I &#9829; systems</h1>
                    <p>Like the concept of storytelling, I'm fascinated by systems because of how <span class="bolded">all-encompassing and grand</span> they can be. In building systems, we're essentially speaking in the language of life itself, describing the myriad interesting ways in which any given moment could play out.</p>
                    <p>Most of my systems design work has been during pre-production, so I don't have much to share in terms of publicly available work samples. However, I'm happy to talk about the type of work I've done.</p>

                    <h3>Voice-Activated Dialogue Interactions</h3>
                    <p>Working at Ready At Dawn was an amazing opportunity to explore narrative design at the <span class="bolded">cutting edge of gaming and development technology</span>. Like many gamers, I've dreamt of being able to speak to my favorite characters and to feel like they're really talking back to <em>me</em>. Speech recognition tech is improving, but problems remain, such as the accurate handling of diverse accents and latency during processing.</p>
                    <p>Driven to bring my voice into the game, I prototyped a few experimental systems that found compromises between the traditional dialogue choice wheel and the life-like speech recognition we all dream of. Thanks to my prototypes, I was able to prove that when an NPC responses to your actual voice, it does indeed feel like being <span class="bolded">truly immersed</span> in the virtual reality of the moment.</p>

                    <h3>Newbie- and Party-Friendly Action Controls</h3>
                    <p>At Telltale Games (before its closing and subsequent revival), stagnation was a concern. Our style had become so predictable that the community had begun referring to "the Telltale formula" to describe their gameplay experiences.</p>
                    <p>Although I wasn't yet officially a designer, I took it upon myself to <span class="bolded">prototype and pitch novel systems</span> to help us grow as a company. For instance, for games that focused more on combat, I devised a system wherein the game controller could be used more reactively, requiring zero familiarity with button labels, which would allow for even complete newbies to <span class="bolded">join in on the fun</span>.</p>

                    <h3>Working Smarter, Not Harder</h3>
                    <p>Back before I became a designer with official engineering support, if I wanted <span class="bolded">specialized tools</span>, making my own was often my only option. My Subtitle Pass Assistant tool, for example, was all about saving clicks and keypresses.</p>
                    <p>As a Creative Development Assistant (CDA) at Telltale, a lot of my time was spent proofreading and processing dialogue scripts &ndash; e.g., fixing spelling errors, and flagging lines that needed special attention from the automated lipsync system. Unfortunately, this work was needlessly cumbersome due to a lack of task-specific tools. After consulting with senior engineering staff, I set about solving this efficiency problem by <span class="bolded">writing a tool of my own</span> in C++.</p>
                    <p>Now, instead of digging through multiple menus every time a line needed attention, the CDAs (of which there were several) would only need a couple clicks, thereby <span class="bolded">greatly increasing our efficiency</span>.</p>
