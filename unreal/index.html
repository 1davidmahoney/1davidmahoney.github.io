                    <h1>A knack for the cinematic</h1>
                    <p>Because of technology like Unreal Engine 5, video games have become more cinematic than ever: They transition between passive and interactive entertainment so smoothly you almost forget you're playing a game. Environments <span class="bolded">come to life</span> like never before, and character performance is now so natural that you can't resist being <span class="bolded">moved by it</span>.</p>
                    <p>The portfolio piece below is mainly meant to show my <span class="bolded">penchant for the cinematic</span> and my <span class="bolded">proficiency with modern tools</span> like Unreal Engine 5. This piece is also meant to demonstrate my Narrative Design skills in action, by way of the creative sensibilities used to plan the piece and the technical know-how used to implement it.</p>

                    <p><em>Runt</em> is a fable-like <span class="bolded">underdog adventure</span> story, where the hero essentially goes from sad puppy to brave guard dog.</p>
                    <p>You play as the youngest and weakest brother in a big family of <span class="bolded">superhuman-esque beings</span> on a verdant alien homestead, where survival means being able to fight all kinds of <span class="bolded">vicious creatures</span>.</p>
                    <p>One day, your siblings' teasing goes too far, so you run away from home in search of self-worth and purpose. You cross paths with an evil hermit and realize you must become more powerful than anyone ever imagined in order to <span class="bolded">save your family and home</span>.</p>
                    <p>Thankfully, with the help of your trusty pet and a few friends you make along the way, you're able to overcome your fear and self-doubt and discover the <span class="bolded">strength within yourself</span> to save the day. Despite how much you've changed, you and your family are just happy to have you back home again.</p>
